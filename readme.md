# Border Radius Generator
## The coolest border-radius generator ever!

### What this does?
It's a simple HTML file, that you can type the number of each corner (on pixels) of the div, and, then you can copy the code.

### Is there some improvement coming?
Hell no kkkkkk I just want to prove that I can do DOM manipulation kkkkkk
