# Border-radius Generator
## The coolest border-radius generator ever!

### What this does?
It's a simple HTML file, that you can type the number of each corner of the div, and, then you can copy the code.

### Is there some improvement coming?
Yes! I want to add a function that adds box-shadow on it :)
